# Ansible Playbooks

These are the ansible playbooks I use to set up my various machines.

- **silverstone** - my main home-server that runs debian, proxmox, and docker
- **cloudshell** - an always-on vps to provide an interactive shell on-the-go.

## Setup
- Install required modules from ansible galaxy with `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`
